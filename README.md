# Additional (unofficial) Newznab+ Themes #
This repository includes additional user-contributed themes for Newznab+. These themes are not "official" and are not supported by the developers.
If you have issues with any theme found here, contact the author as provided. *Some themes have different contact info*

Screenshots are provided in the "screenshots" directory for each theme and are named sanely so you can preview each theme before deciding on the one you want to use.

Themes labeled as full-featured retain all the elements that can be found in the default nn theme, including all menus. Minimalistic themes have most features and/or menus removed to work better with programs like NZB360. Bookmarks might be needed to navigate to special areas of the site, like admin.

All themes have been verified working on SVN revision 2954.

## Installing Themes ##
1. Get the contents of this repository either by [clicking here](https://github.com/Xihuitl/Newznab_Themes/archive/master.zip) to get the current zip or by checking out using git. *Note: it is recommended you check out using git for ease of updating.*
2. Choose the theme you wish to use, and copy that directory into your <newznab/base/path>/www/templates directory. For example, if you installed newznab into /var/www/newznab, you would execute `cp -r Dusplic /var/www/newznab/www/templates`
3. After the theme directory is copied into place, go into Admin -> edit site to choose the new theme. Be sure to use the save button at the bottom of the site settings page.
4. *Not all themes modify the admin templates, so you'll have to get out of the admin area to see changes.*
